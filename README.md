# Object_Detection_Data_Processing-
Using RaspberryPi for Object Detection using TinyML models like Tensorflow Lite, Pytorch Nano and gathering data on mAP value, tem‚Äê perature etc. Also, Preparing Image Data from various sources by combining and cleaning them to make one single dataset of required classes in jupyter notebook.

The first_yolov5.ipynb jupyter notebook file is used to train yolov5 tensorflow and pytorch models. Then those tensorflow models are converted  to tflite files with Yolov5 (1).ipynb jupyter notebook file. All models are tested in raspberry pi400 and the required results are shown in yolov5-model-performance-data.xlsx
